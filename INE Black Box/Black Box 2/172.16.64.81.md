We immediately see this is just a default Apache install page so don't waste time. Gobuster it.

`/default` is still apache so let's check `/webapp`
![webapp](webapp.png)

trying `admin:admin` gives us an error page with some weird HTML rendering, possible SQLi?
![error](error.png)

Looking at the URL we have a possibility:  
`http://172.16.64.81/webapp/process.php?do=login&username=admin&password=admin&language=en` so let's fire up sqlmap and try to get some injection
```
sqlmap -u http://172.16.64.81/webapp/process.php?do=login

Interesting, it tried to redirect to a subdomain, let's add this to our `/etc/hosts` file and go to it. 
![cms](cms.png)

Running sqlmap on this domain yields no SQLi but searching google for ProjectSend r1053 we see a [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/webapp/projectsend_upload_exec/) article for a metasploit module. 


Running this however failed because of a missing `process-upload.php` file -- let's come back later after we hopefully find credentials

Turning on burpsuite proxy we can start going through the websites directory structure, ultimately we find `/img/custom/thumbs/` which has a `users.bak' file. and contains two new username:password pairs  
```
john1:password123
peter:youdonotguessthatone5
```

![index](index.png)

We can try these at the cms login. The username john1 works, however we are taken to a 500 page. If we check burp proxy, we are given some mysql credentials in the response header  
![header_credentials](header_credentials.png)

Connecting to this via mysql and enumarting we will see a table named `flag` within the `cmsbase` database.
