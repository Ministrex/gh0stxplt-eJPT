Trying to go to `/about-us` shows we must login, but if we intercept in burpsuite we can see we have everything we need already.

Making a note of all names found:
```
Elizabeth Lopez
Tara Baker
Becky Casey
Randy Carlson
Pablo Roberts
Bessie Hammond
Gerardo Malone
Sabrina Summers
```

On this machine we also have an odd SSH port of `2222` -- let's check this out
```
ssh 172.16.64.166 -p 2222

Dear employee! Remember to change the default CHANGEME password ASAP.

Awesome, we know there's a password for one of the 8 employees. Since there's only 8 we can manually try them without too much effort until we find that it works with `sabrina` and gets us our first flag.

We also have a `hosts.bak` file; running `file hosts.bak` shows us it's ASCII text so we can cat it and see an `/etc/hosts` file
```
sabrina@xubuntu:~$ cat hosts.bak 
127.0.0.1	localhost
172.16.64.81	cms.foocorp.io
172.16.64.81    static.foocorp.io

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```

We already found the `cms.foocorp.io` because we first went after the .81 box but not `static.foocorp.io` - let's check it out after adding this to our own `/etc/hosts` file.

I poked around for a while but nothing useful was found here so we can move on to the `.81` box at the `cms.foocorp.io` url
