# Notes from INE PTS course towards eJPT certification 

---
---

These are the notes I took when going through INE's PTS course. I also have documented my steps through the three black box labs at the end of the PTS course, but can assure you they are very different from the real exam. They're more so just a challenge to yourself that you have picked up what the PTS course was trying to teach you. 

I passed with 18/20 correct on the eJPT exam in under 4 hours and can say the PTS course teaches everything you need to know to be successful. If you have any questions I'm on twitter [@gh0stxplt](https://twitter.com/gh0stxplt)
